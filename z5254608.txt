Week 1
Had a funeral, but team set up the github and Jira accounts. Originally planned to create a custom project, leaning towards
a travel planner but the lack of a good API to extract travel data would create a huge problem when trying to create such an app.
Team send their idea in for feedback and waited for me to see if I would also agree with it.

Week 2
Lecture feedback for the custom project was not as favourable as we'd like. Team decided to drop the project and go for one of 
the standard ones. We decided to go with the "task planner" project however coming up with useful novel features required a lot
of brainstorming.
