Darius Carlin, z5258461 Diary


========== Week 1 ==========
In the Tuesday lab, we set up Jira accounts and formed the team (excluding Brent who joined week 2).
The team discussed ideas for the project and decided on a custom project idea - Travel Planning app.
I introduced the idea of using Google's Places API to pull information about a location so we can
recommend it to the user. Nguyen suggested using Django/Python for the backend
and React for the frontend. SQLLite was the recommended query language for the database.

On Saturday, we submitted the proposal form and awaited feedback from the lecturer. The three novel features
we described was an algorithm to learn search preferences to recommend locations/events, an auto planner
and system to view, save, and copy other people's planners.


========== Week 2 ==========
On Monday, we received feedback from the lecturer who was not certain our idea would work well.
We were also informed of the new team member Brent. We waiting until the Tuesday lab to discuss further.

In the Tuesday lab, we opted to drop the custom project for either the recipe recommender or the
task manager. After discussion with the tutor, we went with the task management system with the following
novel features. Firstly, a Gantt chart analysis software to find critical path, bottlenecks and cost analysis.
The second was to introduce a task assignment recommender based on team qualities and characteristics.
I sent a email in the evening to ask for clarity on "novelty".

Wednesday morning we received feedback from the lecturer who cleared up definitions. We were then able to confirm
our task assignment recommender was novel but the Gantt analysis was only partially.

On Friday, Nguyen suggested a novel feature - incorporated retrospective/project review, including
a feature to flag certain task cards for the review.

On Saturday, myself, Josh, Newton and Nguyen held a small meeting to setup the github. This includes
a dedicated diary branch. The Jira was also updated to add some cards and a proposal page.
Diaries were added to the github on this day as well. The four of us agreed that a retrospective idea is
good but we do not want to overcommit. Brent was still yet to be added to the group chat so he was absent.
