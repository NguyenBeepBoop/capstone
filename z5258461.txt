Darius Carlin, z5258461 Diary


========== Week 1 ==========
In the Tuesday lab, we set up Jira accounts and formed the team (excluding Brent who joined week 2).
The team discussed ideas for the project and decided on a custom project idea - Travel Planning app.
I introduced the idea of using Google's Places API to pull information about a location so we can
recommend it to the user. Nguyen suggested using Django/Python for the backend
and React for the frontend. SQLLite was the recommended query language for the database.

On Saturday, we submitted the proposal form and awaited feedback from the lecturer. The three novel features
we described was an algorithm to learn search preferences to recommend locations/events, an auto planner
and system to view, save, and copy other people's planners.


========== Week 2 ==========
On Monday, we received feedback from the lecturer who was not certain our idea would work well.
We were also informed of the new team member Brent. We waiting until the Tuesday lab to discuss further.

In the Tuesday lab, we opted to drop the custom project for either the recipe recommender or the
task manager. After discussion with the tutor, we went with the task management system with the following
novel features. Firstly, a Gantt chart analysis software to find critical path, bottlenecks and cost analysis.
The second was to introduce a task assignment recommender based on team qualities and characteristics.
I sent a email in the evening to ask for clarity on "novelty".

Wednesday morning we received feedback from the lecturer who cleared up definitions. We were then able to confirm
our task assignment recommender was novel but the Gantt analysis was only partially.

On Friday, Nguyen suggested a novel feature - incorporated retrospective/project review, including
a feature to flag certain task cards for the review.

On Saturday, myself, Joshua, Newton and Nguyen held a small meeting to setup the github. This includes
a dedicated diary branch. The Jira was also updated to add some cards and a proposal page.
Diaries were added to the github on this day as well. The four of us agreed that a retrospective idea is
good but we do not want to overcommit. Brent was still yet to be added to the group chat so he was absent.


========== Week 3 ==========
Monday, Brent was added to the group chat.

In the Tuesday lab, we discussed our novel features with our tutor. We agreed that the recommendation system 
based on user/team characteristics was novel and substantial. Nguyen came up with an idea to suggested
stackoverflow links to help a user if they are stuck on where to start. All team members were present.

On Friday, I started helping with the proposal, clarifying features and issues so the team could
write the user stories nicely. I also started looking at the required software libraries and 
architecture to see if there would be any concerns when writing the proposal report.

On Saturday, myself, Joshua, Newton and Nguyen worked on the proposal report. The others were adding user stories
to the report as well as user types, software architecture, background research and other requirements.
I began working on drawing user storyboards to demonstrate the UI/UX design for the created user stories.

On Sunday, Brent (who was absent since Tuesday) joined the meeting and informed us of his situation. He worked
on finalising parts of the report. Joshua, Newton and Nguyen continued with the user stories and report
similar to Saturday. I continued to work on the storyboards. We made a few decisions to clarify some of the user stories.
Firstly, we decided on the object hierarchy relating to tasks. The decision was to have a task group that contains
users and task lists, which group task cards by category. Secondly, we made defintions for user types, 
all users are classified as task masters. The owner of a task group is the group owner. Task groups can have moderators. 
The first novel feature recommends a taskto a user using more than just the characteristic/skill tags we 
initially visioned. It also includes past performance and relationships between task dependencies. 
The second novel feature now includes a search for all websites and not just stackoverflow, potentially
using APIs SerpAPI or Google Customer Search JSON API.


========== Week 4 ==========
On early Monday morning, Joshua helped me to annotate the user storyboards to help with readability.
I continued to work on finalising the formatting and rewriting certain sections to add detail before
Joshua submitted the final copy before the deadline.

In the Tuesday lab, we updated the tutor with progress on the current sprint. We decided on who would
be assigned to each user story, which was mostly evenly split excluding Brent. I attempted to setup
my environment but could not finalise the process due to Python compatibility with certain packages.

On Thursday, I finalised the environment setup process and began working on my assigned user stories
with Joshua, who was doing similar user stories. We worked on the database models as well as connecting
to the frontend views. Nguyen, who had more experience with Django, helped with debugging.

On Friday, I continued developing my assigned user stories for tasks with Joshua. One issue that arose
was that the UI/UX drafted in the user storyboards from the proposal required jQuery in order to
sen http requests without refreshing the page. For this sprint we decided to make a url and view for every
UI element, i.e. task creation, list creation, etc. 

On Saturday, the first working prototype was pushed to the repo. I did not do much work today but the 
rest of the group, except Brent, continued to work on improving the user and task stories. The group
managed to resolve some UI and backend issues, most notably Google's email restrictions that was solved by
Newton and Nguyen. Joshua and I, managed to fix some css styling issues that arose with Bootstrap's
auto-css for the Django crispy forms.

On Sunday, the team made final changes and testing to the overall UI/UX experience, including the ability
to view task details and specific lists and groups based on their primary key. Accessing, models based
on their primary key took up some time, but Nguyen was able to resolve that issue. Newton worked on creating 
user profile editing, which had an issue on image uploading, which was resolved by the rest of the team.
All bugs found during the testing process was fixed.


========== Week 5 ==========
Tuesday was the first demo. All user stories assigned to sprint 1 were completed and successfully
demonstrated to the tutor. Myself, Newton, Joshua and Nguyen attended the retrospective meeting immediately
afterwards. The biggest issue brought up was the uncoordinated standup times that were at inconvenient times
and had long durations late into the night. The idea was to start having regular standups at 9pm on Thursdays
and Sundays, as well as a bigger standup on the Tuesday class time. We also briefly discussed how to set 
out the tasks for the new sprint.

Only sparse work like code cleanup and research was done for the rest of this week. 


========== Week 6 ==========
Not much work was done this week due to flexibility week but also due to my focus on other courses.

On Friday, I started looking at some of the user stories, where part of the functionality was already 
covered in sprint 1. This included but was not limited to, updating task details. I also starting looking
at how to implement object deletions with Joshua so we could write the implementation in the next week.


========== Week 7 ==========
On Monday, Joshua submitted the retrospective A report but it did not contain the title page.

Tuesday, we were informed by the tutor that the retro reports were not up to the formatting standards.
So we had to make an urgent submission in lieu of our scrum master Joshua who was absent at the class.
Brent made an appearance to the class after his overseas trip. We helped set up his work environment
and explained sections of the project so he would understand the principles of our system as well as
some technical details. We tasked him to then research from what we just explained and see if he can try
implement a category tagging feature.
