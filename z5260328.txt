Week 1

Formed our group. We decided to go with a custom idea (darius' idea) involving a travel planner. Created my github and jira account. As a team we filled out the custom project form to see whether the lecturer/tutor was fine with it. 
We received feedback on the monday of Week 2 saying we had to elaborate more/think of better and new proposals. New member of the team joined during the weekend. We decided to wait for his say before choosing an official project.
I plan to contribute to the sprint and intial stages of the proposal.

Week 2

After further discussion with our new member and the team, we decided to drop out custom project due to its strictness, hence deciding the task management project. It did take us quite a while to choose a project due to the fact
that we dropped our custom project but also it seems that none of the projects listed stood out to any of us. By listing our the pros and cons of each project and researching similar systems to potential projects, we chose the task management project.
We also spoke which software tools to use, most likely react/django/sqlite. Organised the frequency of standups (Everyday tuesday, thursday, saturday/sunday). Nguyen created the backlogs (Sprint and cards) and discussed also the frequency
of sprints and their time blocks. I plan to get part of the proposal done such as user stories/background/technical depth. 

Week 3

On Tuesday, we established our novelty functions with Nguyen coming up with the idea of an integrated support System and our second novelty function as the characteristic tagging system. During the process of our proposal, Nguyen and I worked on the User stories and Darius and Joshua continued to work on our proposal, including the background, storyboard and other parts of the proposal. I worked on the Software Architechture of our project whilst elaborating on the different softwares we used. We all took part on the user stories table in the proposal. I created the background description in the proposal whilst Josh completed the table of competitive systems. On the Thursday, we continued our user stories that extends into our second and third sprint. Brent started to work with us on Sunday as he did the reference.  We finished our proposal on the sunday and submitted before the due date.

Week 4 
After the submission for the proposal, Nguyen created the environment setup for the backend and he finished his register task card on the Tuesday, so that the others and myself could get started. The Nav bar and base.html Nguyen created also helped us with future templates created. On Wedneday, I began on my first task card which was the password recovery system. At first, it didn't work as I hoped to due to Google's new less secure apps system. Where they didn't allow third party apps or programs to login into your email or use an email. I had to work around it by doing a few tricks which end up successfully working. Additionally, due to Josh, Darius and myself being inexperiene with Django, we had to learn a lot from the internet and Nguyen. Next, I worked on the profile detail and profile edit which included just the details the user registered with. We had frequent standups from Thursday and Monday where every member of the team showed up to contribute to each part and help others as well. Overall, we end up with a functioning website and completing all our task cards.
