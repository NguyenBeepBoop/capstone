Week 1

Formed group during the lab session, created the github and jira accounts. I provided suggestions 
on a possible tech stack that we could use for the project (React, Django, SQLlite). Did research 
for custom project proposal (Darius' Idea) on a holiday/travel planner and reviewed other possible 
projects that we were interested in. We had our custom project initial proposal submitted for review
by our tutor and lecturer. New member joined our team on the weekend so we decided to also wait on
his feedback before proceeding with the idea.

Week 2

Received feedback from the lecturer on our custom project proposal, taking in account of the problems
raised by the lecturer, we decided to drop the custom project and discuss upon which prescribed project
we would want to do. As a team we decided to go with the "task planning" project and brainstorm for 
some novelty features that we could implement. 

Some ideas that we came up with:
  - Gantt chart analysis for optimised workflow by priority and user story point.
  - Card/task suggestions based on user's proficiencies and completed tasks.
  - Retro board integration into task planner for "sprint" reviews/ retrospectives.

Created a Sprint 0 to organise tasks that need to be done until project proposal submission. Had a 
meeting with team, to get started on our project proposal. 

Week 3

Tuesday
Received feedback on our idea for some of the novelty ideas that were discussed during the week. We
decided to go with the novely idea that involved building a characteristic task assignment system
based on the proficiencies of the user. I had also came up with the idea of using including a helper
system where users would be recommended websites on how to complete a task if they were unsure of how
it could be done. After discussion with the team we decided to go forth with this idea as our second 
novelty idea. We also starting putting some user story and cards onto our jira board to help with 
getting our project proposal started.

Thursday
We had our team standup, and decided to work on adding cards and user stories to our jira board to be
added to our project proposal later. Newton and Josh started working on the system architecture 
components of the project whilst I continued to add cards to jira for my team members to update on the 
document. Darius had made a start on the story board for the project proposal.

Friday - Sunday
We continued to work on the project proposal and completed on Sunday evening.
