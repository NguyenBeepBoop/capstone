Week 1

Formed group during the lab session, created the github and jira accounts. I provided suggestions 
on a possible tech stack that we could use for the project (React, Django, SQLlite). Did research 
for custom project proposal (Darius' Idea) on a holiday/travel planner and reviewed other possible 
projects that we were interested in. We had our custom project initial proposal submitted for review
by our tutor and lecturer. New member joined our team on the weekend so we decided to also wait on
his feedback before proceeding with the idea.

Week 2

Received feedback from the lecturer on our custom project proposal, taking in account of the problems
raised by the lecturer, we decided to drop the custom project and discuss upon which prescribed project
we would want to do. As a team we decided to go with the "task planning" project and brainstorm for 
some novelty features that we could implement. 

Some ideas that we came up with:
  - Gantt chart analysis for optimised workflow by priority and user story point.
  - Card/task suggestions based on user's proficiencies and completed tasks.
  - Retro board integration into task planner for "sprint" reviews/ retrospectives.

Created a Sprint 0 to organise tasks that need to be done until project proposal submission. Had a 
meeting with team, to get started on our project proposal.
